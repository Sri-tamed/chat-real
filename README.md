## 🎯 Usage

### Creating a Room
1. Click "Create New Room" on the homepage
2. Allow camera and microphone permissions
3. Share the room link with others

### Joining a Room
1. Paste the room ID in the "Join Existing Room" input
2. Click "Join Room" or press Enter
3. Allow camera and microphone permissions

### During a Call
- Toggle camera on/off
- Toggle microphone on/off  
- End call and return to homepage
- Copy room link to share with others
 - Use the theme toggle in the header (moon/sun icon) to switch between dark and light mode
 - Open Settings (gear) for theme options
 - Open Help (question mark) for FAQ and troubleshooting

### Dark Mode
### Help & Settings Panels
The header includes dedicated buttons for quick access:
- Help button opens an in-app modal with FAQ, troubleshooting, and external resource links.
- Settings button opens a modal where you can change theme or reset to system preference. Media options are placeholders for upcoming releases.

To extend:
1. Add new rows in `SettingsModal` with user preferences (store in localStorage or future backend).
2. Add more FAQ entries in `HelpModal` by appending objects or JSX blocks.
3. Consider adding keyboard focus trapping and ESC key handling for enhanced accessibility.
The application stores your theme preference in `localStorage` under the key `chat-real-theme` and applies it early during page load to avoid a flash of incorrect theme. If no preference is stored, the system color scheme (`prefers-color-scheme`) is used.

Implementation details:
- CSS variables defined in `index.css` under `:root` and `:root[data-theme='dark']`
- A `ThemeProvider` (`useTheme` hook) manages state and persistence
- `ThemeToggle` component in the header provides the UI switch
- Accessible: the toggle button has an `aria-label` that updates per state

## 🔧 Configuration

VITE_STUN_SERVER=stun:your-server.com:3478
VITE_TURN_SERVER=turn:your-server.com:3478
VITE_TURN_USERNAME=your-username
VITE_TURN_PASSWORD=your-password
```

### Browser Compatibility
